# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival
on the Titanic using the well-known Kaggle dataset.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete data science workflow,
including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training,
and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster**
provided by Kaggle.

- Training data: `train.csv`
- Test data: `test.csv`

The dataset contains demographic and travel-related information about passengers,
such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

## Project Workflow

1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Data preprocessing and handling missing values  
4. Encoding categorical features  
5. Feature selection  
6. Model training using Logistic Regression  
7. Model evaluation and performance analysis

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately **73%** on the validation set.
This result demonstrates the effectiveness of basic preprocessing and
classification techniques on structured data.
